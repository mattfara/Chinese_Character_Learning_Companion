# Chinese_Character_Learning_Companion
This program boostraps the Anki spaced-repetition software into a system for learning new Chinese phrases.
It assumes a Chinese deck with separate subdecks for individual characters and phrases.
The program takes a character, scrapes a list of phrases containing it from MDBG.com, and keeps
only the phrases that are not already in Anki but which consist of characters already in Anki.
It then automatically sends the list to a designated expert/tutor via email.
